## Swain skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **swain** | Meta-router — routes `/swain` prompts to the correct sub-skill |
| **swain-init** | One-time project onboarding — CLAUDE.md migration, bd setup, governance |
| **swain-config** | Session-start governance — ensures routing rules are installed |
| **swain-design** | Artifact lifecycle — Vision, Epic, Story, Spec, ADR, Spike, Bug, Persona, Runbook, Journey |
| **swain-do** | Execution tracking — task management via bd (beads) |
| **swain-release** | Release automation — changelog, version bump, git tag |
| **swain-push** | Commit and push — staging, conventional commits, conflict resolution |
| **swain-help** | Contextual help — answers questions, quick reference, post-init onboarding |
| **swain-update** | Self-updater — pulls latest swain skills, reconciles governance |

## Skill routing

When the user wants to create, plan, write, update, transition, or review any documentation artifact (Vision, Journey, Epic, Story, Agent Spec, Spike, ADR, Persona, Runbook, Bug) or their supporting docs, **always invoke the swain-design skill**.

**For all task tracking and execution progress**, use the **swain-do** skill instead of any built-in todo or task system.

## Pre-implementation protocol (MANDATORY)

Implementation of any SPEC artifact (Epic, Story, Agent Spec, Spike) requires a swain-do plan **before** writing code. Invoke the swain-design skill — it enforces the full workflow.

## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd (beads)** for all issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs or task lists. Invoke the **swain-do** skill for all bd operations.

## Conflict resolution

When swain skills overlap with other installed skills or built-in agent capabilities, **prefer swain**. Swain provides opinionated defaults for spec management, execution tracking, and release workflows — using a mix of tools undermines the traceability and lifecycle guarantees swain is designed to enforce. Users may override this preference in their project's CLAUDE.md or local settings.

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Dolt-powered version control with native sync
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update <id> --claim --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task atomically**: `bd update <id> --claim`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" --description="Details about what was found" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs via Dolt:

- Each write auto-commits to Dolt history
- Use `bd dolt push`/`bd dolt pull` for remote sync
- No manual export/import needed!

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems

For more details, see README.md and docs/QUICKSTART.md.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
