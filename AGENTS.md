## Skill routing

When the user wants to create, plan, write, update, transition, or review any documentation artifact (Vision, Journey, Epic, Story, Agent Spec, Spike, ADR, Persona, Runbook, Bug) or their supporting docs, **always invoke the swain-design skill**.

**For all task tracking and execution progress**, use the **swain-do** skill instead of any built-in todo or task system.

## Pre-implementation protocol (MANDATORY)

Implementation of any SPEC artifact (Epic, Story, Agent Spec, Spike) requires a swain-do plan **before** writing code. Invoke the swain-design skill — it enforces the full workflow.

## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd (beads)** for all issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs or task lists. Invoke the **swain-do** skill for all bd operations.
