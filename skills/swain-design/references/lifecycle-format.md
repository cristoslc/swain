# Lifecycle Table Format

Every artifact embeds a lifecycle table tracking phase transitions:

```markdown
### Lifecycle

| Phase | Date | Commit | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| Planned | 2026-02-24 | abc1234 | Initial creation |
| Active  | 2026-02-25 | def5678 | Dependency X satisfied |
```

Commit hashes reference the repo state at the time of the transition, not the commit that writes the hash stamp itself. Commit the transition first, then stamp the resulting hash into the lifecycle table and index in a second commit. This keeps the stamped hash reachable in git history.
