 * resolved specifier, so pre-importing via an absolute path does NOT make
 * a subsequent bare `import('grammy')` succeed.
 *
 * Solution: adapters call `importPeer('grammy')` which first tries the
 * normal `import()`, then falls back to `createRequire(botDir).resolve()`
 * to locate the package in the bot's own node_modules.
